# TeamSideDetector Plugin

The TeamSideDetector plugin for [PenguLoader](https://pengu.lol/) helps you quickly identify which side (Blue or Red) your team is on during champion select in League of Legends. This can be useful for planning strategies and picks based on your team's side.

## Features

- Displays a clear, centered notification showing your team's side (Blue or Red)
- Activated with a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift)
- Works only during champion select phase
- Unobtrusive design that doesn't interfere with the game interface
- Clean, minimal code with low resource usage
