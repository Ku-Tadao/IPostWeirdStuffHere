# SimpleAccept Plugin

The SimpleAccept plugin for [PenguLoader](https://pengu.lol/) automatically accepts your League of Legends match queues. Never miss a game again, whether you're tabbed out or grabbing a quick snack!

## Features

- Automatically accepts match queues as soon as they pop up
- Works in all queue types (Normal, Ranked, ARAM, etc.)
- Runs silently in the background
- No configuration needed
- Lightweight with minimal resource usage

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [PenguLoader](https://pengu.lol/) installed for League of Legends
2. Download the SimpleAccept plugin from this repository
3. Place the `SimpleAccept` folder in your PenguLoader plugins directory:
   ```
   C:/Program Files/Pengu Loader/plugins
   ```
4. Start League of Legends

## Usage

The plugin works automatically once installed:
1. Queue up for any game mode
2. When a match is found, it will be accepted automatically
3. A console message "Match accepted automatically!" will appear (viewable in developer tools if needed)

## Troubleshooting

If auto-accept isn't working:
1. Verify PenguLoader is properly installed and running
2. Check that the plugin folder is in the correct location
3. Try restarting your League client
4. Make sure you're actually in queue for a game
5. Check if your client is responding (if the client itself is frozen, the plugin can't help)

## Important Notes

- The plugin will accept ALL match queues automatically
- Make sure you're ready to play before queuing up
- Be responsible with this plugin - don't queue up if you might be AFK
